With a BASIC book on my knee at 8 years old I knew I wanted to be a programmer. I have worked as a mobile developer in fin-tech, the health-care industry, furniture, retail, grocery, marketing & games. I keep up on both platforms, but I prefer iOS. I love Salmon, ask me about them. I am very inspired by great design and employ my idiomatic knowledge of the platforms and their interactions to craft the best user experience. I crave collaboration and mentoring and am an eager pair-programmer.
